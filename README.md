# gstaticsitegenerator
(where g doesn't mean anything (Generic, or Gianni, my name, probably), and the other words are the description)

The main goal of this application (except the learning of Python for other uses) is to create a simple way to make a site and update without the work of experts.

After installed and found all working and aestethic rules, I would put a text file, an image, or more, in the source directory, and then get the site updated, while running with cron or the less possible of user work.
Then deploy, still automatically, the new files on web site.  

You know that static pages site have less security problems, but also less functions than dynamic, but I'm trying to do, principally for my sites, a blog module, image galleries, rss feeds, and some other facilities. I don't want to create themes or have a one-click site, but an expandable way of doing pages.

To have more informations, go to [my site](http://www.antani.li/gstatic)
I'm going to make a revision of some things, because I need to expand some functionality, so probably actual version is a bit problematic for some uses. I hope I will do necessary changes in small amount of time: for some users it will not affect the use of application, the others should ask me how to resolve, or get an older version: sorry, but I've changed a lot of ideas on the way to drive the app.
